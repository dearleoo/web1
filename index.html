        <strong>Star Wars Day</strong>, employees from Lucasfilm and ILM reflect on what made them fans and what keeps them enthralled with the galaxy far, far away.
        <br>It’s been more than 40 years since George Lucas first introduced the world to Star Wars, but the timeless stories are just as relevant today as they were in 1977. Star Wars binds us, as families discover the saga together and strangers become instant friends over the shared language of quoting the films. And in the decades since the first film’s debut, many fans have grown up to take their own journey to Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic, where their love of Star Wars translated into their work as artists, writers, and editors.
        <br>To celebrate Star Wars Day, we asked a few current Lucasfilm employees to search their feelings and answer one simple question: “What does Star Wars mean to you?” Here are their powerful and heartfelt responses, in their own words.
